# Surrey_Climate_Comission
As part of my collaboration with the Surrey climate Commission, I created an updated report on CO2 Emissions for Surrey. The results were presented to the Commission and they are use to plan the Commissions' strategy and points of action. The files include:  data analysis in R and .ppt with results and comments.
